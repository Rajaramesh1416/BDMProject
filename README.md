🔍 Project Overview

The study analyzes four months of real operational data (June–September 2025) to identify inefficiencies in:

Inventory management

Credit handling and cash flow

Staffing and peak-hour operations

Using structured analytical methods, the project transforms unorganized, manual records into actionable business insights.

🛠️ Methods & Tools Used

Data Cleaning & Processing (from handwritten notes, WhatsApp messages, verbal records)

Descriptive Statistics for sales, inventory, and credit behavior

ABC Analysis for inventory prioritization

RFM Analysis for customer credit risk segmentation

Time-Series & Trend Analysis for sales and peak-hour demand

Profit & Margin Analysis for financial performance evaluation

Tools:

Excel / Google Sheets

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

📈 Key Insights

Class A items (Milk, Jaggery Powder, Sugar) contribute ~70% of inventory cost and cause frequent stockouts

A small group of customers accounts for most outstanding credit, impacting cash flow

Peak demand occurs during 7–10 AM and 4–7 PM, leading to service delays due to single-person operations

Profit drops are driven by bulk procurement days, not low sales demand

✅ Recommendations

Implement reorder levels and buffer stock for critical inventory

Apply RFM-based credit limits and digitized credit tracking

Introduce part-time staffing during peak hours

Optimize procurement frequency to stabilize daily profits
